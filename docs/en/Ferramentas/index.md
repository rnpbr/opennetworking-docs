## :octicons-book-24: **Introduction**

Before you start using the monitoring tools, it is essential to configure the communication foundation between your labs. For this, we use a dedicated Docker network called **br-lab**. The **br-lab** network facilitates the integration of analysis tools with the labs created in Containerlab, eliminating the need to repeatedly configure each tool for different labs.

### :octicons-gear-24: **Step 1: Configuring the br-lab Docker Network**

Access the [br-lab Network Configuration Guide](Primeiros passos: preparando o ambiente.md) to configure your Docker network. This network will be responsible for connecting your labs to the monitoring system efficiently, allowing multiple tools to function in an integrated manner.

## :octicons-search-24: **Step 2: Choosing a Monitoring Tool**

After configuring the **br-lab** network, you can select the tool that best suits your needs. Each of the tools listed below offers specific functionalities for different types of monitoring, whether of network devices, traffic, or logs.

### :material-compare-horizontal: **Tool Comparison**

The following table provides an overview of the tools we cover in our tutorials, highlighting their main features, monitoring type, and pricing options:

## :material-test-tube: **Step 3: Implementation and Testing**

After selecting the most suitable tool, follow the specific tutorials to configure and integrate the chosen solution with your network environment created in **Containerlab**. Each guide offers step-by-step instructions to ensure a smooth and functional integration of monitoring tools with your labs.

### :octicons-tools-24: **Test Scenario Examples**:

- **Monitoring Network Devices with LibreNMS**: Configure LibreNMS to monitor switches and routers within your lab.
- **Analyzing Logs and Events with ELK Stack**: Collect and visualize log data generated by network devices.
- **Packet Capture with EDSHARK**: Run network diagnostics and analyze packets captured directly from routers.

## :material-tools: **Future Tools**

We are constantly testing and adding new tools to our repertoire. Some options we are considering exploring soon include:

- **Zabbix**: Monitoring and data visualization platform.
- **Grafana**: Monitoring and data visualization platform.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and data visualization server.
- **Telegraf**: Metrics collector that integrates with Prometheus and other monitoring systems.
- **OpenElastic**: A scalable and flexible solution for auditing logs and events, based on the Elastic Stack.
- **OpenNMS**: Robust tool for monitoring networks and systems, with a focus on large-scale networks.

These tools can be integrated into your lab environment with **Containerlab**,
allowing you to create a robust ecosystem for network management and analysis.
