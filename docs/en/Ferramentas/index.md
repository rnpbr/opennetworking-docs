## :octicons-book-24: **Introduction**

Before you begin using the monitoring tools, it is essential to configure the communication base between your labs. For this, we use a dedicated Docker network called **br-lab**. The **br-lab** network facilitates the integration of analysis tools with the labs created in Containerlab, eliminating the need to repeatedly configure each tool for different labs.

### :octicons-gear-24: **Step 1: Configuring the br-lab Docker Network**

Access the [br-lab Network Configuration Guide](Primeiros passos - preparando o ambiente.md) to configure your Docker network. This network will be responsible for connecting your labs to the monitoring system efficiently, allowing multiple tools to work in an integrated manner.

## :octicons-search-24: **Step 2: Choosing a Monitoring Tool**

After configuring the **br-lab** network, you can select the tool that best suits your needs. Each of the tools listed below offers specific functionalities for different types of monitoring, whether for network devices, traffic, or logs.

### :material-compare-horizontal: **Tool Comparison**

The following table provides an overview of the tools we cover in our tutorials, highlighting their main features, monitoring type, and pricing options:

## :material-test-tube: **Step 3: Implementation and Testing**

After selecting the most suitable tool, follow the specific tutorials to configure and integrate the chosen solution with your network environment created in **Containerlab**. Each guide provides step-by-step instructions to ensure a smooth and functional integration of the monitoring tools with your labs.

### :octicons-tools-24: **Test Scenario Examples**:

- **Monitoring Network Devices with LibreNMS**: Configure LibreNMS to monitor switches and routers within your lab.
- **Log and Event Analysis with ELK Stack**: Collect and visualize log data generated by network devices.
- **Packet Capture with EDSHARK**: Run network diagnostics and analyze captured packets directly from routers.

## :material-ip-network: **br-lab Network Configuration and Fixed Addresses**

All tools are configured to be attached to the **br-lab** network, and to facilitate their use, regardless of the lab, they have fixed IPs. These IPs can be consulted in the list below, allowing you to connect directly to each tool without the need for additional configurations for each new lab.

### **Table: Fixed IPs of the Tools**

| Service | IP | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| librenms-db | 172.10.10.100 | librenms |
| librenms-redis | 172.10.10.101 | librenms |
| librenms-msmtpd | 172.10.10.102 | librenms |
| librenms-librenms | 172.10.10.103 | librenms |
| librenms-dispatcher | 172.10.10.104 | librenms |
| librenms-syslogng | 172.10.10.105 | librenms |
| librenms-snmptrapd | 172.10.10.106 | librenms |
| elk-setup | 172.10.10.107 | ELK |
| elk-elasticsearch | 172.10.10.108 | ELK |
| elk-kibana | 172.10.10.109 | ELK |

This addition includes the Docker network configuration, the explanation of the fixed IPs, and how they facilitate the integration of the tools in your lab environment.

## :material-tools: **Future Tools**

We are constantly testing and adding new tools to our repertoire. Some options we are considering exploring soon include:

- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and data visualization server.
- **OpenElastic**: A scalable and flexible solution for auditing logs and events, based on the Elastic Stack.
- **OpenNMS**: Robust tool for monitoring networks and systems, with a focus on large-scale networks.
- **Akivorado**: Data flow monitoring tool for networks.

These tools can be integrated into your lab environment with **Containerlab**,
allowing you to create a robust ecosystem for network management and analysis.
