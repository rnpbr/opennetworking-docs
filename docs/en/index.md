Welcome to the **Open Networks** project! This project aims to provide a solid foundation for configuring and simulating networks using modern and efficient tools: **Netbox**, **Containerlab**, and **Netreplica**.

The **Open Networks** project was developed for network professionals and enthusiasts who want to:

- **Explore**: Test different network configurations in a controlled environment.
- **Automate**: Use templates to standardize and automate network device configurations.
- **Replicate**: Reproduce real network environments in virtual labs for testing and validation.
- **Manage**: Centralize the documentation and management of network infrastructures efficiently.

With these tools, the project aims to simplify the creation, management, and documentation of complex network topologies, providing flexibility and scalability.

## Lab Workflow

The workflow illustrates the Netreplica workflow in the context of a network simulation environment. Below is a detailed explanation of each step in the process:

## Workflow Structure

### 1. Topology
The network topology is the starting point and defines the structure and interconnection of network devices.

### 2. Netbox
The topology is documented and managed in Netbox, a centralized platform for network infrastructure management. Netbox stores detailed information about devices, IP addresses, and physical connections.

### 3. Netreplica
Netreplica is responsible for synchronizing configuration information from Netbox and preparing it for simulation. It obtains the data via API and generates YAML configuration files necessary for the simulation.

### 4. Configurations
The configuration files generated by Netreplica contain the detailed specifications of how network devices should be configured.

### 5. Containerlab
Containerlab uses the generated configuration files to create and manage complex network topologies in Docker containers.

### 6. Lab (Docker Stack)
The simulation is run in a lab environment using a Docker stack. The defined topology is reproduced, allowing for testing and validation.

### 7. Graphite
To monitor and visualize metrics and performance of the simulation, Graphite is integrated into the lab. It collects and displays relevant data for analysis.

## Workflow Summary

1. **Topology Definition:** The structure and interconnection of network devices are defined.
2. **Documentation in Netbox:** The topology is documented and managed in Netbox.
3. **Synchronization with Netreplica:** Netreplica synchronizes information from Netbox via API and generates YAML configurations.
4. **Topology Creation with Containerlab:** Containerlab uses the YAML configurations to create the network topology in Docker containers.
5. **Simulation Execution:** The topology is executed in a Docker lab environment.
6. **Monitoring with Graphite:** The performance and metrics of the simulation are monitored and visualized with Graphite.
