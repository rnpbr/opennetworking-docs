## :material-bookmark: 1. Description

### :octicons-goal-16: 1.1 Lab Objective

The "Multivendor Zabbix Monitoring" lab demonstrates the simulation of the interconnection of three routers from different vendors—vJunos (Juniper), Huawei VRP, and Cisco XRD—using Containerlab. The devices are interconnected in a ring topology, and routing is performed by the OSPF protocol, allowing dynamic route exchange. Communication with Zabbix occurs via SNMP, enabling real-time monitoring.

### :material-lan: 1.2 Lab Topology

![Lab Topology](../../../../../../../img/labs_imgs/Topologia_Multvendor_Zabbix.svg)

The topology of this lab consists of three routers interconnected in a ring topology, allowing direct communication between the devices. Each router is configured with OSPF, ensuring dynamic routing between interfaces. Monitoring is performed from an external network called br-lab, to which the routers are connected by virtual interfaces. This configuration allows Zabbix to monitor the connectivity and performance of the network in real-time, using SNMP as the metric collection protocol.

## :octicons-search-16: 2. Applications

### **Application Example**

This lab can be used in various academic and professional contexts. It is useful for simulating real-world network operation and monitoring scenarios, serving as an environment for validating configurations and testing interoperability between routing protocols and monitoring tools.

**Possible Applications:**

* **Training of NOC (Network Operations Center) teams:**
    Replicates real-world connectivity situations between Juniper, Huawei, and Cisco routers in a ring topology, using OSPF and SNMP, allowing technicians to learn how to detect, analyze, and resolve failures.
* **Evaluation of interoperability between vendors:**
Allows testing how different manufacturers interact via OSPF, analyzing route convergence, and identifying inconsistencies in the dynamic exchange of routing information.
* **Validation of SNMP templates in Zabbix:**
Controlled environment to validate, adjust, or develop SNMP monitoring templates for multiple router manufacturers, ensuring compatibility and accuracy in metric collection.
* **Teaching of dynamic routing protocols:**
Provides practical learning about the configuration, maintenance, and exchange of routes via OSPF in point-to-point and ring topologies, including failure analysis and reconvergence.
  *	**Monitoring and automatic discovery tests:**
Allows evaluating the automatic device discovery functionality via SNMP and the monitoring of connectivity and performance in real-time, simulating various network scenarios.
  *	**Simulation of network policies and ACLs:**
Enables applying traffic filtering rules and verifying their impact on communication and monitoring, with analysis of logs and SNMP traps in Zabbix.

!!! warning "Attention"
    Verify that your processor has **hardware virtualization support** and that this feature is **enabled in the BIOS/UEFI**.
    - In **Intel** processors, this technology is called **VT-x** (Intel Virtualization Technology).
    - In **AMD** processors, it is known as **AMD-V** (AMD Virtualization).

    Without this feature enabled, images like **vJunos-router** will not work correctly.

## :fontawesome-solid-prescription-bottle: 4. Deploying the Lab

Here are the instructions to **deploy the lab**. You can choose a **ready-made deployment** or a **customized** one.

### :material-git: 4.1 Ready-Made Deployment

This method allows the user to **download a pre-assembled version** of the lab, with the topology and configurations already defined. Simply download the repository and proceed to the start of the execution.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Ready-made deployment is useful for those who want to start quickly with a configured environment.

#### :octicons-download-16: Downloading the Lab

To download the lab, execute the command corresponding to your operating system.

=== "Linux/Mac"

    ```bash
    curl -L -o get.sh "https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/labs/-/raw/main/monitoramento-zabbix-multvendor/get.sh" && sh get.sh && cd monitoramento-zabbix-multvendor
    ```


=== "Windows"

    ```bash
    curl -L -o get.bat "https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/labs/-/raw/main/monitoramento-zabbix-multvendor/get.bat" && call get.bat && cd monitoramento-zabbix-multvendor
    ```

This command will download the installation script and direct you to the lab directory.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Before running the scripts, check if the execution permissions are correct (use `chmod +x get.sh` on Linux/Mac).

## 7. :octicons-rocket-24: Next Steps

When starting the lab, Zabbix will be bare without templates. To configure automatic discovery and templates, access [Configuring Auto Discovery](../../../../Ferramentas/Zabbix/Configurando%20Auto%20Discovery.md)

!!! warning "Attention"
    Currently, automatic discovery is only adding the correct template for Juniper. For other manufacturers, you must add the template manually.
