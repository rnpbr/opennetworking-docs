# :material-bookmark: Multivendor Logs Telegraf

This lab simulates, via Containerlab, the interconnection between three Juniper, Huawei and Cisco routers, with dynamic routing via OSPF, log export via Syslog using Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf and Grafana.

---

## :material-bookmark: 1. Description

### :octicons-goal-16: 1.1 Lab Objective

The objective of the lab is to simulate the export of logs from three routers from different manufacturers (Juniper, Huawei and Cisco) to a centralized monitoring server, using the Syslog protocol. The monitoring system is composed of Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf and Grafana, allowing the collection, storage and visualization of network metrics in real time.

### :material-lan: 1.2 Lab Topology

![Lab Topology](../../../../../../../img/labs_imgs/Topologia_Logs_Telegraf.svg)

**Topology Description**

* Three routers (Juniper, Cisco, Huawei) interconnected in a linear topology with point-to-point /31 links.
* Dynamic routing via OSPF between routers.
* Log collection via Syslog udp (514).
* Observability with the TICK stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf) and Grafana.
* External network `br-lab` connects the nodes to the monitoring infrastructure.

## :octicons-search-16: 2. Applications

### Application Examples

This lab can be explored in several academic and applied research scenarios, serving as a basis for experimentation with monitoring and visualization of traffic in networks with multiple routers.

#### Possible Applications:

* **Training of NOC teams in a multivendor environment**: Simulates real operations with Juniper, Huawei and Cisco routers, using OSPF and log export via Syslog, allowing analysis of connectivity and fault resolution.
* **Validation and testing of log collection via Syslog**: Allows verifying the compatibility and behavior of different vendors in sending logs to Telegraf.
* **Real-time metrics visualization and analysis**: Validate and test Grafana template forms to work with logs.
* **Centralized monitoring with Telegraf**: Evaluates Telegraf's ability to receive and process logs from heterogeneous devices, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
* **Teaching monitoring system integration**: Provides practical learning about Syslog configuration, metric collection and visualization in TICK stacks and Grafana in a multivendor scenario.

!!! warning "Attention"
    Check if your processor has **hardware virtualization support** and if this feature is **enabled in the BIOS/UEFI**.
    - In **Intel** processors, this technology is called **VT-x** (Intel Virtualization Technology).
    - In **AMD** processors, it is known as **AMD-V** (AMD Virtualization).

    Without this feature enabled, images such as the **vJunos-router** will not work correctly.

## :octicons-play-16: 5. Initializing the Lab

After downloading or customizing, follow the steps below to **start the lab**.
Run the command below inside the downloaded directory.

```bash
sudo containerlab deploy
```

This command will create the router containers, configure the links, and start the monitoring services.

!!! tip "Debugging"
    Use `docker logs -f <container_name>` to check the status of the services, if something does not work.

## :octicons-browser-16: 7. Observability and Visualization

!!! Warning "Attention"
    Due to the way configurations are applied to the vJunos-router, the syslog configuration must be done manually.
    Follow the step-by-step instructions below to send all system logs to the remote log server.

### Step by step

Access node1 via ssh and execute:

```junos
configure
```

* Enters **configuration mode** of Junos.
* All subsequent commands will change the equipment's configuration.

```junos
set system syslog host 172.10.10.114 any any
```

* Defines the remote log server (**172.10.10.114**) as the destination.
* `any any` means: send **any facility** (system, kernel, daemon, auth etc.) at **any severity level** (emergency, alert, critical, warning, info, debug).
* In practice: **all system events will be sent to this server**.

```junos
set system syslog host 172.10.10.114 source-address 172.10.10.201
```

* Defines the **source IP** of the log packets as **172.10.10.201** (the IP of the vJunos-router).
* This ensures that syslog traffic leaves through the interface that has this address.
* It is important for the log server to correctly recognize the origin of the messages.

```junos
commit
```

* Applies the changes made to the configuration.
* Only after this command will the logs begin to be sent to the configured destination.
