## :fontawesome-solid-prescription-bottle: 1. **Description**

### :octicons-goal-16: 1.1 **Lab Objective**

The objective of this lab is to import network devices and their configurations into Netbox from Zabbix, as well as demonstrate the basic operation of OSPF routing between three routers connected in a ring and monitored via SNMP.

### :material-lan: 1.2 **Lab Topology**
Below is the topology in image format, representing the routers, servers, and their connections.

![Topologia.svg](../../../../../../../img/labs_imgs/Topologia_discovery_lab.svg)

The routers are configured with the following technologies:

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Used for dynamic routing in the network, allowing routers to exchange information about routes and topology updates.
- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**: Used for network monitoring and management, allowing access to telemetry information from devices.

## :octicons-search-16: **2. Applications**

### Examples of Applications

This lab is focused on practical experimentation with automatic device discovery in IP networks, integrating monitoring (Zabbix) and documentation (Netbox) tools. It is ideal for studies and training involving inventory automation, topology discovery, and network data integration.

#### Possible Applications:

- **Network discovery automation:** Demonstrates how to automatically identify active devices in a network using Zabbix and how to import this data into Netbox, reducing manual effort in asset mapping.

- **NetDevOps and inventory management training:** Excellent for training professionals in modern network operations practices, focusing on tool integration via API and automation of infrastructure documentation.

- **Centralized device repository creation:** Enables building a reliable database about the network in real-time, based on information discovered via SNMP and documented in Netbox.

- **Zabbix + Netbox integration study via API:** Allows exploring the use of RESTful APIs to synchronize information between monitoring and network asset management tools.

- **SNMP discovery and centralized management teaching:** Provides a practical experience for students and professionals to understand how network data collection (interfaces, IPs, manufacturers, etc.) occurs and how this data is processed by management tools.

## :material-tools: **3. Requirements**
### :material-alert: 3.1 Prerequisites

To start the lab, the following components must be installed and configured:

- Netbox
- Containerlab
- Docker
- Python

If your environment is not configured, follow the steps in [Configuration Guide](../../../../Getting%20Started.md)

### :material-alert: 3.2 Computational Requirements Table

| Requirement           | Details |
|---------------------| --- |
| **CPUs**            | 4 vCPUs (recommended minimum) |
| **RAM Memory**     | 12 GB |
| **Disk Space** | 10 GB |
| **Containerlab**    | 0.64.0 |
| **Created Network**     | br-lab |

!!! tip "Tip"
    Check if the Docker and Containerlab versions are compatible to avoid errors during deployment.

!!! warning "Attention"
    Verify that your processor has **hardware virtualization support** and that this functionality is **enabled in the BIOS/UEFI**.
    - On **Intel** processors, this technology is called **VT-x** (Intel Virtualization Technology).
    - On **AMD** processors, it is known as **AMD-V** (AMD Virtualization).

    Without this functionality enabled, images such as **vJunos-router** will not function correctly.

## :octicons-tools-16: 4. Installation

### :material-network-strength-4-cog: 4.1 Configuring the Docker Network

Before starting the containers, create the bridge network that will interconnect the devices:

```bash
docker network create \
  --driver=bridge \
  --opt com.docker.network.bridge.name=br-lab \
  --subnet=172.10.10.0/24 \
  br-lab
```

### :material-git: 4.2 Cloning the Lab Repository

Execute the script below to download and configure the lab automatically:

=== "Linux/Mac"

    ```bash
    curl -L -o get.sh "https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/labs/-/raw/main/discovery-lab/get.sh?ref_type=heads&inline=false" && sh get.sh && cd discovery-lab
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```bat
    curl -L -o get.bat "https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/labs/-/raw/main/discovery-lab/get.bat?ref_type=heads&inline=false" && call get.bat && cd discovery-lab
    ```

!!! tip "Tip"
    On Linux/Mac, use `chmod +x get.sh` before running the script if it does not have execute permission.

## :fontawesome-solid-house-chimney: 5. Environment Deployment

### :material-router-wireless: 5.1 Starting the Routers with Containerlab

Start the topology with the command:

```bash
sudo clab deploy -t clab/discovery-lab.clab.yaml
```

!!! warning "Debug"
    Devices may take about 10 minutes to become fully operational.
    If an error occurs, check the command output for possible error messages. Use `docker logs <container_name>` to debug.

### :material-server: 5.2 Starting Zabbix
!!! tip "Tip"
    If you already have a configured Zabbix environment, just skip this step.

To start the container with Zabbix:

```bash
docker compose -f zabbix-docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
The Zabbix web interface will be available on port 81.

---
## :material-relation-one-to-one: 6. Integration with Zabbix and Netbox
In this step, you need to create an API token in both Zabbix and Netbox to add the token to the .env file.

### :material-import: 6.1 Importing Routers to Zabbix

1. Access the scripts folder:
```bash
cd scripts/
```
2. Create and activate the Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Configure the environment with your credentials:
```bash
mv .env.example .env
nano .env
```
Example .env:
```bash
 # Zabbix
ZABBIX_TOKEN=zabbix_token                     # API Token
ZABBIX_URL=http://yourdomain/api_jsonrpc.php  # API Access URL
ZABBIX_USER=Admin                             # Default User
ZABBIX_PASSWORD=zabbix                        # Default Password
ZABBIX_GROUP=Juniper                          # Group to add the routers to
ZABBIX_TEMPLATE="Juniper by SNMP"             # Monitoring template for Juniper routers

# Netbox
NETBOX_URL=http://yourdomain/api              # API Access URL
NETBOX_TOKEN=netbox_token                     # API Token

# Devices
DEVICE_USERNAME=admin                         # Default access username for routers
DEVICE_PASSWORD=admin@123                     # Default access password for routers
```
5. Now to import the routers into Zabbix, run the command:
```bash
python3 import_zabbix.py
```

### :octicons-key-16: 6.2 Generating API Tokens
Creating an API Token in Zabbix.

1. Access the Zabbix interface.
2. Go to **Users** > **API Tokens**.
3. Click **Create**, fill in the fields, and copy the generated token.
4. Update the `ZABBIX_TOKEN` field in `.env`.

Creating an API Token in Netbox.

1. Access the Netbox interface.
2. Navigate to **Admin** > **API Tokens**.
3. Click **Add**, associate it with a user, and copy the token.
4. Update the `NETBOX_TOKEN` field in `.env`.

### :material-import: 6.3 Importing Routers to Netbox
Now with the environment fully configured, you can import the routers into Netbox with the command:
```bash
python3 import_netbox.py
```

With the script successful, you can view the routers within Netbox with their respective information!
