## :material-bookmark: 1. Description

### :octicons-goal-16: 1.1 Lab Objective

The “zabbix-rnp-lab” laboratory demonstrates the simulation of the connection between two routers representing the interconnection between BA and ES in the RNP backbone, using Containerlab. Routing between devices is performed using the OSPF protocol, ensuring dynamic route exchange. The main focus is to integrate this topology with Zabbix via SNMPv2, enabling real-time monitoring. In addition, the laboratory highlights the automatic device discovery functionality on the network.

### :material-lan: 1.2 Lab Topology

![Lab Topology](../../../../../../../img/labs_imgs/Topologia_Zabbix.svg)


The topology of this lab consists of two routers interconnected by a point-to-point /31 network, allowing direct communication between them. The routers are configured with OSPF to ensure dynamic routing between the interfaces. Network monitoring is done through an external network called br-lab, where the routers are connected by virtual interfaces. Through this configuration, Zabbix is able to monitor network connectivity and performance.

## :octicons-search-16: 2. Applications

### **Application Example**

This laboratory can be used in various academic and professional contexts. It is useful for simulating real-world network operation and monitoring scenarios, serving as an environment for validating configurations and testing interoperability between routing protocols and monitoring tools.

**Possible Applications:**

* **Training NOC (Network Operations Center) teams**: Replicates real-world connectivity situations between routers with OSPF and monitoring via SNMP to familiarize technicians with fault detection and analysis.
* **Performance evaluation of automatic discovery via SNMP**: Allows testing the operation of host discovery under different network and topology conditions.
* **Validation of SNMP templates in Zabbix**: Can be used to validate or develop SNMP monitoring templates for routers in controlled environments.
* **Teaching dynamic routing protocols**: Provides a practical learning environment about configuration and route exchange via OSPF in point-to-point networks.

!!! warning "Attention" 
    Check if your processor has **hardware virtualization support** and if this feature is **enabled in the BIOS/UEFI**.
    - In **Intel** processors, this technology is called **VT-x** (Intel Virtualization Technology).
    - In **AMD** processors, it is known as **AMD-V** (AMD Virtualization).

    Without this feature enabled, images such as **vJunos-router** will not work correctly.

## :fontawesome-solid-prescription-bottle: 4. Deploying the Lab

Here are the instructions to **deploy the lab**. You can choose a **ready-made deployment** or a **customized** one.

### :material-git: 4.1 Ready-made Deployment

This method allows the user to **download a pre-assembled version** of the laboratory, with the topology and configurations already defined. Simply download the repository and proceed to the start of execution.

!!! tip "Tip"
    The ready-made deployment is useful for those who want to get started quickly with a configured environment.

#### :octicons-download-16: Downloading the Lab

To download the lab, run the command corresponding to your operating system.

=== "Linux/Mac"

    ```bash
    curl -L -o get.sh "https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/labs/-/raw/main/zabbix-lab/get.sh?ref_type=heads&inline=false" && sh get.sh && cd zabbix-lab
    ```
