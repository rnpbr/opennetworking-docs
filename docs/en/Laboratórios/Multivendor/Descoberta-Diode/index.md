## :fontawesome-solid-house-chimney: 5. Environment Deployment

### :material-router-wireless: 5.1 Starting the Routers with Containerlab

Here, the three Juniper/Cisco/Huawei devices will be initialized.
The boot time may vary depending on the manufacturer.

```bash
sudo clab deploy -t clab/discovery-lab.clab.yaml
```

!!! warning "Debug"
    The devices may take about 10 minutes to become fully operational.
    If an error occurs, check the command output for possible error messages. Use `docker logs <container_name>` to debug.


### :material-server: 5.2 Starting the Diode Server
!!! tip "Tip"
    If you already have the Diode server configured, just skip this step.

1. Let's create a new folder to store the diode-server files:
```bash
mkdir diode-server
cd diode-server
```

2. Now, let's download the quick start script:
```bash
curl -sSfLo quickstart.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netboxlabs/diode/release/diode-server/docker/scripts/quickstart.sh
chmod +x quickstart.sh
```

3. Then, just run the script passing the url of your netbox:
```bash
./quickstart.sh https://<netbox-server>
```

4. Finally, just start the containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. To extract the credentials needed to install the plugin, execute the command below:
```bash
echo $(jq -r '.[] | select(.client_id == "netbox-to-diode") | .client_secret' ./oauth2/client/client-credentials.json)
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    **Store the token**, you will need to add it to the configuration below.


---
### :material-relation-one-to-one: 5.3 Installing the Plugin in Netbox
In this step, we will install the diode plugin, which is responsible for establishing the connection between the diode-server and Netbox.

#### :fontawesome-solid-gear: **5.3.1 Configuring the Netbox version:**

1. First, let's clone the Netbox Docker repository:
```bash
git clone -b release https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker.git
```
2. Now, let's go to Release 3.2.1:
```bash
cd netbox-docker/
git checkout 3.2.1
```

!!! tip "Information"
    We changed the repository branch to have access to Netbox version 4.2.4.

!!! tip "Tip"
    All commands below will be executed inside the netbox root directory `netbox-docker/`.


#### :material-text-box: **5.3.2 plugin_requirements.txt**
This file contains a list of Netbox plugins (as PyPI Python packages) that must be installed during the Docker image build.

Execute the following command to write the package inside the `plugin_requirements.txt` file.

```bash
echo "netboxlabs-diode-netbox-plugin" >> plugin_requirements.txt
```

#### :material-docker: **5.3.3 DockerFile-Plugins**
This is the DockerFile used to build the custom docker image.

1. Create the file and access it with an editor:
```bash
nano DockerFile-Plugins
```

2. Copy the content below and paste it into the file:
```bash
FROM netboxcommunity/netbox:v4.2.4

COPY ./plugin_requirements.txt /opt/netbox/
RUN /usr/local/bin/uv pip install -r /opt/netbox/plugin_requirements.txt
```

#### :material-docker: **5.3.4. docker-compose.override.yml**
As the name implies, this file contains the configurations that will overwrite the `docker-compose.yml`.

If you haven't configured the `br-lab` network yet. Access: [Configuring the Docker Network](../../../../Laboratórios/Juniper/vJunos/Lab%20Descoberta/index.md/#31-configurando-a-rede-docker)

1. Create the file and access it with an editor:
```bash
nano docker-compose.override.yml
```

2. Copy the content below and paste it into the file:
```bash
services:
  netbox:
    image: netbox:latest-plugins
    pull_policy: never
    ports:
      - 8000:8080
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-Plugins
    networks:
      - br-lab

  netbox-worker:
    image: netbox:latest-plugins
    pull_policy: never
    networks:
      - br-lab

  netbox-housekeeping:
    image: netbox:latest-plugins
    pull_policy: never
    networks:
      - br-lab

  postgres:
    networks:
      - br-lab

  redis:
    networks:
      - br-lab

  redis-cache:
    networks:
      - br-lab

networks:
  br-lab:
    external: true
```

The changes made were:

- adding Netbox to the `br-lab` network.
- changing the dockerfile to `Dockerfile-Plugins`, created previously.
- Also changed the image of the services to: `netbox:latest-plugins`.

#### :material-power-plug-outline: **5.3.5. plugins.py**
This file is responsible for setting the specific configurations for each plugin.

1. Access the file with the editor:
```bash
nano configuration/plugins.py
```

2. Copy and paste the content into the file:
```bash
PLUGINS = [
    "netbox_diode_plugin",
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox_diode_plugin": {
        # Diode gRPC target for communication with Diode server
        "diode_target_override": "grpc://localhost:8080/diode",

        # Username associated with changes applied via plugin
        "diode_username": "diode",

        # netbox-to-diode client_secret created during diode bootstrap.
        "netbox_to_diode_client_secret": "..."
    },
}
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    The token stored during diode-server installation must be passed in the option: `netbox_to_diode_client_secret`.

---

#### :simple-docker: **5.3.6 Build and Deploy!**
Now your Netbox is configured and ready for deploy, follow the commands below and build a new instance of Netbox!

1. Build the image:
```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
```

2. Start the containers:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. Create the necessary migrations with the command below:
```bash
docker compose exec -it netbox ./manage.py migrate netbox_diode_plugin
```

#### :material-import: **5.3.7. Generating credentials for the agent**
We need to create credentials for the diode agent to communicate and forward the data collected from the devices to the diode-server.

1. Access your Netbox and go to the side menu.
2. Go to `Diode` > `Client Credentials`.
3. Click on the top button `Add Credential`.
4. Type a name for your credential.
5. Store the `Client Id` and `Client Secret`.

---

## :octicons-key-16: 6. Orb-Agent
The orb-agent is a diode component responsible for collecting data on devices.

### 6.1 **Configuring the agent**

1. Access the `orb-agent` folder:
```bash
cd ./orb-agent
```

2. In the `.env` file, configure the variables according to your environment.
```bash
DOCKER_NETWORK=br-lab                      # Container Network
DOCKER_SUBNET=172.10.10.0/24               # Devices Network
DIODE_CLIENT_ID=                           # Diode Client Id
DIODE_CLIENT_SECRET=                       # Diode Client Secret
DIODE_HOST=<your-ip>:8080                  # Diode Server Url
AGENT_NAME=agent1                          # Agent Name
SITE_NAME=RNP                              # Netbox Site Name
MULTIDEVICE_COMMUNITY="public"             # Device Community
```

Here are the `Client Id` and `Client Secret` generated in the diode plugin in Netbox.

3. Now, let's apply the variables to the juniper import template with the command:
```bash
set -o allexport && source .env && envsubst < agent.snmp.template.yaml > agent.yaml
```

### 6.2 **Starting Data Collection**
Finally, just bring up the container to start importing devices into Netbox!

```bash
docker compose up
```

✅ Track in real-time in Netbox the devices being collected by the agent.

⏱️ In addition, you can configure a collection interval for the agent to perform the import automatically and periodically, without the need for manual intervention.
