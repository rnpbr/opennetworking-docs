# :material-bookmark: Telegraf Monitoring

This lab simulates, via Containerlab, the interconnection between three routers representing the GO–MS–MT connection on the RNP backbone, with dynamic routing via OSPF, flow export via IPFIX, and monitoring via SNMP/Telemetry using Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, and Grafana.

## :material-bookmark: 1. Description

### :octicons-goal-16: 1.1 Lab Objective

The `telegraf-lab` lab's primary objective is to simulate traffic monitoring of a topology with three interconnected routers (GO, MS, and MT), using dynamic routing protocols (OSPF), flow export (IPFIX), and monitoring with SNMP. The collection and visualization of network metrics are performed with modern observability tools: **Telegraf**, **InfluxDB**, **Chronograf**, and **Grafana**.

### :material-lan: 1.2 Lab Topology

![Lab Topology](../../../img/labs_imgs/Topologia_Telegraf.svg)

**Topology Description**

*   Three routers (GO, MS, MT) interconnected in a linear topology with /31 point-to-point links.
*   Dynamic routing via OSPF between the routers.
*   Traffic metrics collection via IPFIX and SNMP.
*   Observability with the TICK stack (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf) and Grafana.
*   External network `br-lab` connects the nodes to the monitoring infrastructure.

## :octicons-search-16: 2. Applications

### Application Examples

This lab can be explored in various academic and applied research scenarios, serving as a basis for experimentation with traffic monitoring and visualization in networks with multiple routers.

#### Possible Applications:

*   **Training network and NOC teams**: Simulates real operations with OSPF, IPFIX, and SNMP, facilitating traffic behavior analysis.
*   **Traffic analysis with IPFIX**: Allows exporting flows and studying traffic patterns between domains.
*   **Metrics visualization with Grafana**: Supports performance studies, bottlenecks, and network utilization peaks.
*   **Distributed monitoring with Telegraf**: Evaluates simultaneous data collection from multiple routers with different protocols.
*   **Teaching routing and telemetry protocols**: Ideal environment for practical advanced networking classes.

## :material-tools: 3. Requirements

Below are listed the minimum hardware and software requirements to run the lab. Make sure to include the essential tools, such as **Containerlab** and **Docker**, in addition to the previously created `br-lab` network.
To learn more about these items, access:

- [br-lab Network Creation](../../Ferramentas/Primeiros passos - preparando o ambiente.md)
-  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.docker.com/get-started/">Docker Installation</a>
-  <a target="_blank" href="https://containerlab.dev/install/">Containerlab Installation</a>

And have the telegraf stack previously installed. To learn more about zabbix installation, access: [Telegraf Installation](../../Ferramentas/Telegraf/index.md)

### :material-alert: Minimum Requirements Table:

| Requirement           | Details              |
| ------------------- |-----------------------|
| **CPUs**            | 6 vCPUs               |
| **RAM Memory**     | 12 GB                 |
| **Disk Space** | 10 GB (recommended)   |
| **Containerlab**    | 0.45.0 or higher    |
| **Docker Engine**   | 23.0.3 or higher    |
| **Images**         | `vr-vjunos:23.2R1.14` |
| **Docker Network**     | `br-lab`              |

!!! warning "Attention"
    Check if your processor has **hardware virtualization support** and if this feature is **enabled in the BIOS/UEFI**.
    - On **Intel** processors, this technology is called **VT-x** (Intel Virtualization Technology).
    - On **AMD** processors, it is known as **AMD-V** (AMD Virtualization).

    Without this feature enabled, images such as **vJunos-router** will not work correctly.

## :fontawesome-solid-prescription-bottle: 4. Deploying the Lab

You can deploy via a ready-made script or manually configure the lab files.

### :material-git: 4.1 Ready-Made Deployment

This method allows the user to **download a pre-assembled version** of the lab, with the topology and configurations already defined. Simply download the repository and proceed to the start of execution.

!!! tip "Tip"
    Ready-made deployment is useful for those who want to quickly get started with a configured environment.

#### :octicons-download-16: Downloading the Lab

Execute the script below to download and configure the lab automatically:

=== "Linux/Mac"

    ```bash
    curl -L -o get.sh "https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/labs/-/raw/main/telegraf-lab/get.sh?ref_type=heads&inline=false" && sh get.sh && cd telegraf-lab
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```bat
    curl -L -o get.bat "https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/labs/-/raw/main/telegraf-lab/get.bat?ref_type=heads&inline=false" && call get.bat && cd telegraf-lab
    ```

!!! tip "Tip"
    On Linux/Mac, use `chmod +x get.sh` before running the script if it does not have execute permission.

---

## :octicons-play-16: 5. Initializing the Lab

After downloading or customizing, follow the steps below to **start the lab**.
Run the command below inside the downloaded directory.

```bash
sudo containerlab deploy
```

This command will create the router containers, configure the links, and start the monitoring services.

!!! tip "Debugging"
    Use `docker logs -f <container_name>` to check the status of services if something does not work.
