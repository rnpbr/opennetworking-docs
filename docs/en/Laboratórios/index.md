# **Containerlab**

Containerlab is a powerful tool for creating and managing virtualized network labs. With it, you can simulate complex network topologies using Docker containers. Below are the prerequisites and recommended analysis tools for use with Containerlab.

## **Prerequisites**

---

Before you start using Containerlab, make sure you have installed:

- **Docker**: Containerlab uses Docker to create and run the containers that make up the virtualized network. Install Docker according to the instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).
- **Containerlab**: Install Containerlab according to the instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://containerlab.dev/install/).

## **Labs**

## **Analysis Tools**

---

In addition, here are some recommended analysis tools that may be useful for studying and using the labs:

- **LibreNMS**: A web-based network monitoring platform that provides insights into network performance and health.
- **Wireshark**: A powerful network protocol analyzer that allows you to capture and analyze packet traffic in detail.
-

These tools can help in analyzing and debugging problems, as well as in continuously monitoring the virtualized network created with Containerlab.
