# Documenting the Labs

Contributing to the documentation of labs in **Containerlab** is a simple process, but it's important to follow certain steps to ensure all links and functionalities work correctly. This page provides the necessary instructions for documenting a lab, as well as configuring the essential scripts for the proper functioning of the deployment process.

## 1. Creating Lab Documentation

### Creating Images to Represent Labs

It's important that the lab documentation includes images representing the lab's network topology. To do this, follow the [Guide: Creating Images to Represent Labs](Guia Criando Imagens para Representar Laboratórios.md).

### Steps to Document the Lab

Here are the main steps for documenting your lab:

1. **Create Lab Description and Objective**:
    - Describe what the lab does and which protocol or functionality is being demonstrated.
2. **Document the Lab Topology**:
    - Use the created images to illustrate the lab's network topology. If necessary, insert additional diagrams explaining how the devices are interconnected.
3. **Include Usage Examples**:
    - Provide examples of commands and actions that users can execute within the lab to test the functionality.
4. **List Requirements**:
    - Clearly define the hardware and software requirements, such as the Docker version, Containerlab, and network configurations.
5. **Deployment Instructions**:
    - Document the lab deployment, whether it's the ready-made or custom version. Be sure to follow the deployment guides with appropriate links.
6. **Access and Credentials**:
    - Create a table detailing the IPs of each device in the lab and their respective access credentials.

!!! tip "Tip"
    To follow a consistent documentation standard, you can use the [template](Template lab.md) that comes pre-structured with tips. It will serve as a basis for you to adapt the content of your lab, ensuring that all sections are correctly addressed.

To use the documentation template, simply access **docs/pt/Laboratórios/Contribua/Template lab.md**, create a copy in the labs folder, name it after your lab, and fill in the information.

## 2. Scripts for Quick Download

To ensure that the lab download and deployment process works correctly, it is necessary to include two essential scripts within the lab folder in GitLab. These scripts will allow the lab to be downloaded and configured automatically with a simple command.

### 2.1 `get.sh` Script

The `get.sh` script is used on Linux/Mac systems to automatically download and decompress the lab. It checks if the `tar` command is installed and, if not, installs the necessary package before downloading the file.

### How It Works:

1. **Dependency Verification**: The script checks if the `tar` package is installed. If not, it attempts to install it using the system's package manager (`apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`, or `pacman`).
2. **Download and Decompression**: The script downloads the `.tar` file containing the lab and decompresses it into the destination directory.

### `get.sh` Script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to check if a command is installed
check_command() {
    command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Function to install packages
install_package() {
    if [ -x "$(command -v apt-get)" ]; then
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y "$1"
    elif [ -x "$(command -v dnf)" ]; then
        sudo dnf install -y "$1"
    elif [ -x "$(command -v yum)" ]; then
        sudo yum install -y "$1"
    elif [ -x "$(command -v pacman)" ]; then
        sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm "$1"
    else
        echo "Error: Unsupported package manager. Install '$1' manually."
        exit 1
    fi
}

if ! check_command tar; then
    echo "The 'tar' package is not installed. Installing..."
    install_package tar
fi

# URL of the tar file
URL="<https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/lab/-/archive/main/labs-main.tar?path=<lab-name>>"

# Name of the file to save
FILENAME="lab-main.tar"

# Directory to decompress the files to
DEST_DIR="./"

# Download the file
echo "Downloading $FILENAME..."
curl -L -o $FILENAME "$URL"

# Check if the download was successful
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error downloading the file."
    exit 1
fi

# Decompress the file
echo "Decompressing $FILENAME..."
tar -xf $FILENAME -C $DEST_DIR --strip-components=1

# Check if the decompression was successful
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error decompressing the file."
    exit 1
fi

# Remove the tar file after decompressing
rm $FILENAME

echo "Download and decompression completed successfully."

```

### Variables to Modify:

- **`URL`**: Change the URL to match the repository and the path to the lab within GitLab.

---

### 2.2 `get.bat` Script

The `get.bat` script is used on Windows systems to download and decompress the lab in a similar way to `get.sh`, but with commands compatible with the Windows environment.

### `get.bat` Script:

```bat
@echo off
setlocal

REM URL of the tar file
set "URL=https://git.rnp.br/redes-abertas/docker-composes/-/archive/main/docker-composes-main.tar?path=<lab-name>"

REM Name of the file to save
set "FILENAME=lab-main.tar"

REM Directory to decompress the files to
set "DEST_DIR=."

echo Downloading %FILENAME%...
curl -L -o %FILENAME% %URL%

REM Check if the download was successful
if not exist %FILENAME% (
    echo Error downloading the file.
    exit /b 1
)

echo Decompressing %FILENAME%...
tar -xf %FILENAME% -C %DEST_DIR% --strip-components=1

REM Check if the decompression was successful
if %errorlevel% neq 0 (
    echo Error decompressing the file.
    exit /b 1
)

REM Remove the tar file after decompressing
del %FILENAME%

echo Download and decompression completed successfully.

endlocal
pause

```

### Variables to Modify:

- **`URL`**: Change the URL to the specific path of your lab in the GitLab repository.

## 3. Ensuring the Scripts are Correct

To ensure that the quick download process works correctly, **both scripts (get.sh and get.bat) must be included in the lab folder in question within the lab repository**. This ensures that, when using the download links, users can download and decompress the lab efficiently, without problems.

!!! tip "Tip"
    When including the scripts in GitLab, verify that the URLs are configured correctly with the names corresponding to the repository folder and the lab name.

With these steps, you can effectively contribute to the lab documentation and ensure that all download links and scripts are working correctly. without changing the structure of the documentation or adding anything extra.
