# :material-power-plug-outline: Diode Plugin

The Diode plugin for NetBox is a powerful solution for those who want to automate network device data discovery and ingestion. With it, NetBox dynamically receives information through agents or custom scripts, which perform the collection, processing, and insertion of data directly into the system. This functionality facilitates integration with complex environments and promotes continuous and automated documentation of the network infrastructure.

## :material-receipt-text-edit-outline: **1. Components**
Diode is composed of three main components that work together to perform automated data ingestion into NetBox:

1. **NetBox Diode Plugin:** Responsible for integration with the NetBox ORM and API key management, allowing NetBox to accept external data in a secure and structured manner. [Installing the Diode Plugin](./Instalando%20o%20Diode%20Plugin.md)

2. **Diode Server:** Acts as the core of the service, processing received data and performing reconciliation with existing information in NetBox. See here how to install [Installing the Diode Server](./Instalando%20o%20Diode%20Server.md)

3. **Diode Client:** Implemented as a Python SDK, this component collects data from devices and sends it to the server via gRPC/protobuf. It can be easily incorporated into custom scripts or existing integrations. See here how to install [Installing the Diode Client](./Instalando%20o%20Diode%20Client.md)
